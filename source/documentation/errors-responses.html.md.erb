# Error Responses

This section explains the error responses that may be returned by the View Self Assessment Account API. It describes the meaning of each error, root causes, and what action developers or end users should take to resolve them.

All error responses follow standard HTTP status codes.

## 400 Bad Request
**Message:** Invalid request format or parameters.

The request was malformed, missing required data, or included unsupported parameters. This error usually relates to how the request was constructed.

| **Scenario**                                       | **Cause**                                                         | **What to do**                                   |
| -------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Missing authentication token                       | The request does not include an `Authorization` header            | Ensure the request includes a valid bearer token |
| Invalid or missing Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR) | The UTR is missing, not 10 digits, or contains invalid characters | Include a valid 10-digit UTR in the request path |

> **Note:** Check your integration against the [API specification](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation) to avoid request format issues.

## 401 Unauthorized
**Message:** Authorisation failed.

The request could not be completed because the required authorisation was not confirmed. If you are an agent, this may occur when valid credentials and a correct UTR are provided, but HMRC cannot verify that you have permission to access the client’s data.
