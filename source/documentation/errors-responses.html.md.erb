# Error Responses

This section explains the error responses that may be returned by the View Self Assessment Account API. It describes the meaning of each error, common causes, and what action developers or end users should take.

All error responses follow standard HTTP status codes.

---

## 400 Bad Request
**Invalid request format or parameters.**

The request was malformed, missing required data, or included unsupported parameters. This error usually relates to how the request was constructed.

| Scenario | Cause | What to do |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Missing authentication token | Request is missing the `Authorization` header | Ensure a valid bearer token is provided (unlikely unless integration is misconfigured) |
| Invalid or missing UTR | UTR is missing, not 10 digits, or contains invalid characters | Provide a valid 10-digit numeric UTR in the request path or body |

> **Note:** Check your integration against the [API specification](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation) to avoid request format issues.

---

## 401 Unauthorized
**Authorisation failed.**

The agent’s credentials are valid and the UTR is correct, but HMRC could not confirm access permission for this client.

| Scenario | Cause | What to do |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Agent not authorised | Agent has no active relationship with the client | Ask the client to authorise the agent via the appropriate HMRC service (e.g. MTD or traditional SA) |
| Credentials mismatch | The credentials used differ from those used during authorisation | Use the same Government Gateway ID or Agent Services Account used when authorisation was granted |
| Agent access expired or revoked | A previous authorisation is no longer valid | Ask the client to reauthorise the agent |
| Confidence level not met (250) | The individual has not verified their identity to the required level | Ask the client to log in and complete identity verification in their [HMRC personal tax account](https://www.gov.uk/personal-tax-account) |

> **Note:** HMRC cannot confirm if an agent is enrolled in both legacy and MTD services. Both enrolment and authorisation must be in place and match the credentials used.

---

## 403 Forbidden
**Access not permitted.**

The request was valid, but the agent does not have the correct permissions or enrolments to access the Self Assessment data.

| Scenario | Cause | What to do |
|----------|-------|------------|
| No Self Assessment enrolment | The agent is not enrolled for IR-SA-AGENT or MTD for Income Tax | Enrol as an agent using: [Sign up for MTD for ITSA](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/sign-up-your-client-for-making-tax-digital-for-income-tax) |
| Agent type is “supporting” | The credentials used belong to a supporting user, not a principal | Use credentials for the principal (subscriber) user who holds the enrolment |
| Unsupported enrolment | The agent’s enrolment type is not compatible with Self Assessment | Use only supported enrolments: `IR-SA-AGENT` or MTD Agent Services |

> **Note:** Supporting users cannot access client-level Self Assessment or financial data.

---

## 500 Internal Server Error
**Unexpected internal error. Please contact the service desk.**

This error indicates an unexpected issue occurred in HMRC systems. It is not caused by the request or client-side integration.

| Scenario | Cause | What to do |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Internal issue (e.g. NINO-related) | Backend failure unrelated to request structure | Wait and retry. If the issue persists, contact the service desk with a correlation ID |
| Other unexpected issue | Internal logic or system state error | Contact the HMRC service desk with timestamp and endpoint information |

> **Note:** From the user's point of view, this is a system error. HMRC will need to investigate and resolve.

---

## 503 Service Unavailable
**Service temporarily unavailable. Please try again later.**

This error is returned when a required backend service is temporarily down or undergoing maintenance.

| Scenario | Cause | What to do |
|----------|-------|------------|
| Authentication (Auth) service unavailable | The Auth platform is offline | Wait and retry later. This is typically short-lived |
| CESA unavailable | Core SA system (e.g. CESA) is offline; other systems may remain available | Retry after a short interval. In some cases, partial data may be returned |
| Other HMRC platform unavailable | A dependency such as identity verification or legacy data store is unavailable | Retry. If error persists, contact the service desk with details |

> **Note:** For known or scheduled outages, check the [HMRC API status page](https://api-platform-status.production.tax.service.gov.uk/).
