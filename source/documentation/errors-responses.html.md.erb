# Error Responses

This section explains the error responses that may be returned by the View Self Assessment Account API. It describes the meaning of each error, root causes, and what action developers or end users should take to resolve them.

All error responses follow standard HTTP status codes.

## 400 Bad Request
**Message:** Invalid request format or parameters.

The request was malformed, missing required data, or included unsupported parameters. This error usually relates to how the request was constructed.

<table>
    <tr>
      <th>Scenario</th>
      <th>Cause</th>
      <th>What to do</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Missing authentication token</td>
      <td>The request does not include an <code>Authorization</code> header</td>
      <td>Ensure the request includes a valid bearer token</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Invalid or missing Unique Taxpayer Reference (UTR)</td>
      <td>The UTR is missing, not 10 digits, or contains invalid characters</td>
      <td>Include a valid 10-digit UTR in the request path</td>
    </tr>
</table>

> **Note:** Check your integration against the [API specification](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation) to avoid request format issues.

## 401 Unauthorized
**Message:** Authorisation failed.

The request could not be completed because the required authorisation was not confirmed. If you are an agent, this may occur when valid credentials and a correct UTR are provided, but HMRC cannot verify that you have permission to access the client’s data.

  <tr>
    <th>Scenario</th>
    <th>Cause</th>
    <th>What to do</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Agent cannot access client’s Self Assessment data</td>
    <td>The agent does not have an active relationship with the client</td>
    <td><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/how-to-get-authorised-to-act-as-a-tax-agent-on-behalf-of-your-clients">Follow these steps</a> to get authorised to act on behalf of the client</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Individual cannot access their Self Assessment data</td>

    <td>Contact the SDST team at <a href="mailto:SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk">SDSTeam@hmrc.gov.uk</a> for further support</td>
  </tr>
</table>

## 403 Forbidden
**Message:** Access not permitted.

The request was valid, but the user is not registered for Self Assessment and cannot access this data.

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Scenario</th>
    <th>Cause</th>
    <th>What to do</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Agent cannot access client’s Self Assessment data</td>

    <td><a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/find-out-how-to-register-as-a-professional-tax-agent-with-hmrc">Follow this guidance</a> to register as a professional tax agent with HMRC</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Supporting agent cannot access client’s Self Assessment data</td>
    <td>Supporting agents cannot access financial data</td>
    <td>
      Supporting agents have limited access to Making Tax Digital for Income Tax services. They can only view a client’s business and property income. They cannot carry out all tasks available to main agents and cannot access the client’s Self Assessment account through this API.

      To view a client’s Self Assessment account, a supporting agent must ask the client to approve a change to main agent authorisation.
