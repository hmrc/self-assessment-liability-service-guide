# Agent Services

As an agent, you can manage Self-Assessment (SA) obligations on behalf of your clients by setting up access through the Agent Services portal. This page guides you through the process of setting up and using your SA account effectively.

##Setting Up Your SA Account Access

### 1) Register for Agent Services

To act on behalf of clients for Self-Assessment, you’ll need to:

* Have an existing HMRC agent code.
* Register for the Agent Services Account if you haven’t already.

Go to: [HMRC Agent Services Account Registration](https://www.gov.uk/guidance/get-an-hmrc-agent-services-account)

### 2) Link Your Existing Agent Credentials

Once registered:

* Sign in to the [Agent Services Account][ASA].
* Link your existing agent credentials (used for online SA services) to this new account.

This allows HMRC to recognize you as an authorised agent across digital services, including SA, Making Tax Digital, and more.

### 3) Add or Authorise Clients

To manage SA for a client:

* Invite the client to authorise you via your [Agent Services Account][ASA].
* You’ll receive a link to send to your client to digitally approve your authorisation.
* Once accepted, you can submit Self Assessment returns, check statuses, and manage correspondence on their behalf.

#### Manage Your Client List

* You can view all clients who’ve authorised you in your agent account.
* Regularly review and remove clients who are no longer under your management.

#### Use Agent Online Services (AOS) as Needed

Some legacy SA tasks are still handled through the older Agent Online Services (AOS) portal. Ensure you maintain your credentials for:

* Filing returns using HMRC software
* Managing client records not yet migrated to new systems

#### Security & Compliance Notes

* Always protect your login credentials.
* Inform HMRC immediately if your firm’s status or details change.
* You must only access accounts you are authorised for. Acting without valid authorisation may result in penalties.

#### Support & Troubleshooting

* Forgotten agent login or password? Use the recovery options on the HMRC sign-in page.
* Need help with authorisation? Contact the Agent Dedicated Line.
* Technical issues with the portal? Visit HMRC Service Availability and Issues
