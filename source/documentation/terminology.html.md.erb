# Terminology

## A-Z

### 6 years +1
The Self-Assessment Liabilities API provides third parties with data for the past 7 years, more often known as 6+1 years, from the date of the request. The +1 year refers to the current year.

### Agents
A person or organisation authorised to deal with HMRC on behalf of an individual or business entity. Agents are typically accountants, tax advisers, or other professionals who are appointed by the taxpayer to deal with their tax affairs on their behalf.

### Affinity Group
An Affinity Group is a classification used by HMRC to identify the type of user accessing HMRC services, such as individual, organisation, or agent, based on their Government Gateway credentials.

### Allocation
When a payment is made, it will be allocated towards outstanding liabilities. However, the allocation is not immediate and may not be reflected on the customer’s Self Assessment account straight away.

There are two common allocation issues this service helps to prevent:

*Unallocated payments*

These are payments made using the correct UTR (Unique Taxpayer Reference), but there is no charge or liability currently present on the account for the payment to be allocated to. This can result in the payment remaining in credit until a matching charge is created.

*Unmatched payments*

These occur when a payment is made using an incorrect or outdated UTR. In these cases, there is no matching Self Assessment account for the payment to be applied to, which can result in delays or misallocations.

### Amendment
A change to a tax return, this could be sent by the taxpayer or an agent authorised to act on their behalf. An amendment could also be as a result of a HMRC investigation.

### API (Application Programming Interface)
An API is a set of rules and protocols that allows different software applications to communicate with each other. APIs enable the integration of data, services, and functionalities from various applications, making it easier for developers to build complex systems without starting from scratch.

### Charges
A charge is the formal record of an amount due (by the tax payer) in HMRC’s systems. A charge could be in credit if the customer has paid too much towards it, but initially the charge will always be a debit. Charges are also known as liabilities (which is the preferred terminology used for charges).

Each charge includes:

* A unique customer reference
* A unique charge reference
* A description of why the money is owed
* The amount
* The tax type(s) involved
* The period the liability relates to
* A due date

### Coded out
When HMRC makes a payment plan with a taxpayer, their tax code is altered to manage that arrangement and ensure they are charged correctly. Being coded out and having a payment plan are two separate things. If you are coded out the underpayment is automatically collected, a payment plan is something that is agreed with our debt management team and payments would be collected by Direct Debit. Either way, no further penalties will be charged. Taxpayers are only coded out until the underpayment is cleared. Coded out is an internal (non-userfacing) term/status to indicate that their tax code has been changed for this reason.

### Coded Out Amount
A coded out amount is a debt that HMRC collects by reducing the taxpayer’s tax-free allowance in their PAYE tax code. This results in more tax being deducted from their salary, effectively recovering the debt over time.

A person or organisation authorised to deal with HMRC on behalf of an individual or business taxpayer. Agents are typically accountants, tax advisers, or other professionals who are appointed by the taxpayer to deal with their tax affairs on their behalf.

### Confidence Levels
In order to allow an HMRC visitor to access tax services we must have some confidence that the person is who they claim to be.  The identity confidence level required will differ depending on what the service allows a visitor to see or do.  A service which allows a visitor to submit some basic information about their financial history for example may require a lower confidence level than a service which allows a visitor to view or amend personal sensitive information.

### Credits & Payments
Credits refer to payments made to HMRC by the taxpayer Credits could come from a payment, a return showing money due back to the taxpayer or an assessment made by an HMRC officer showing money is due back to the taxpayer. Credit may also be used to indicate that an account has a positive balance. For example, a taxpayer may have overpaid so the account is in credit and the excess is due to be refunded by a repayment.

### Current position
Current Position is a summary of the following balances and dates on an account:

* Total Overdue Balance
* Total Payable Balance
* Payable Due Date
* Total Pending Balance
* Pending Due Date
* Total Balance

This current position includes both positive and negative amounts due for different years. For example, a taxpayer might have overpaid for one tax year but owe for another.

### Debits
A debit is a sum that is payable by the taxpayer to HMRC. Established penalties, liabilities and interest may be included in a debit.

### Interest
Interest is an amount added to the due balance if payment is late. It can also be applied positively when an account has been overpaid.

### Liabilities
A liability refers to the total amount a taxpayer owes to HMRC in a given tax year. This includes:

* Tax (e.g. Income Tax, VAT, CGT)
* Penalties
* Interest
* Other statutory debts

It is a broader concept that represents the taxpayer’s obligation to pay. For example, a Self Assessment liability might include a balancing payment due on 31 January, plus any late payment penalties or interest.

### Payable Due Date
The payable due date is the legal deadline by which a tax payment must be received by HMRC. It is defined in legislation as a specific calendar date, not by reference to working days.

### Penalties
Penalties are punitive fees that are added to a tax payer’s account.

They can be incurred as a result of:

* late to register for self assessment
* sending a tax return after the deadline
* late payment

Penalties may be applied in addition to accruing interest. Historically, Penalties were known as Surcharges. Although the term is no longer used by HMRC it may persist in older documents and data.

### Pending Due Date
The earliest Due Date found against pending charges, payment must be made in a minimum of 30 days.

### Repayments
If a taxpayer has overpaid for a tax year then HMRC will refund the amount overpaid to the taxpayer’s bank account, this is known as a repayment. Historically Repayments were known as Refunds and this name may persist in older documents and data.

### Self Assessment
Self-assessment is a system used by HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) in the UK that allows individuals to report their own income, capital gains, and other financial details to determine their tax liability.

### Statement
Similar to a bank statement. Each taxpayer with an SA liability is issued periodically (unless the issue of statements has been inhibited) with a statement known as the ‘Self Assessment Statement’ (up to June 2006 this was known as the ‘Self Assessment - Statement of Account’). The statement shows the current position on the taxpayer record.

### Tax code
The rate at which people are taxed is managed using tax codes.

### Total Overdue Balance
The sum of all charges whose Due Date is in the past

### Total Pending Balance
The sum of all charges whose Due Date is 30 days or more

### Total Payable Balance
Total Payable Balance is the overall total amount due from a SA taxpayer. Most commonly this will be the amount owed but it is possible that no money is due, or that the account has a positive balance from overpayment.

### Unique Tax Reference
A UTR number is your 'unique taxpayer reference' number. HMRC assigns each self-assessment taxpayer a different number in order to track their tax records. All UTR numbers have 10 digits, and sometimes there's a letter 'K' at the end.Once an individual gets their UTR number it stays with them all your life - just like their National Insurance number.
