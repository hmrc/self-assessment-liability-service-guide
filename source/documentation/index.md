# View Self Assessment account service guide

***

This service guide explains how you can integrate your software with the [View Self Assessment Account API][TBD].

## Overview

Self Assessment is a system we use to collect Income Tax.

Tax is usually deducted automatically from wages, pensions, and savings through Pay As You Earn (PAYE). However, people and businesses with other types of income may have to pay Income Tax through Self As
Some individuals and businesses manage their own Self Assessment liabilities. Others have an agent who manages them on their behalf.

It is possible to manage Self Assessment liabilities using commercial software. To support this, we provide APIs to:

* retrieve details from us to help determine and manage Self Assessment liabilities
* make payments or view outstanding Self Assessment liabilities

To use these APIs, the end user must:

* be an individual or an agent
* be registered for Self Assessment as an individual or an agent
* have an appropriate HMRC online account
