# View Self Assessment account service guide

Version 0.5 issued 22 July 2025
***

This service guide explains how you can integrate your software with the [View Self Assessment Account API][TBD].

## Overview

The View Self Assessment Account API provides third-party systems and developers with access to a structured, itemised view of a taxpayer's Self Assessment (SA) account. It enables trusted external systems such as agent platforms or accounting software to retrieve up-to-date details of charges, payments, credits, and interest applied to an individual's SA account.

This service is read-only and is designed to support better transparency and reconciliation of SA accounts, helping reduce user confusion and contributing to the wider HMRC goal of preventing misallocated payments.

### Purpose
To give third-party software real-time and on-demand access to a taxpayer’s SA account breakdown so that individuals and agents can:

* Verify how payments have been applied
* Reconcile account activity with their own records
* Understand the amount owed and due dates before making a payment

> It is recommended this API is used in conjunction with [Initiate payment API](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/api/service/third-party-payments-external-api/1.0) to increase the likelihood of payments being correctly allocated based on current account data.

### Key features

* Granular breakdown of SA transactions: charges, payments, credits, and interest
* Effective dates for accurate reconciliation
* Status indicators (e.g. due, cleared, overdue)
* Totals and running balances where applicable

### What this service does

* Exposes detailed Self Assessment account data via a secure API
* Supports integration into agent and accounting platforms
* Facilitates user understanding of payment application and account balance

### What this service does not do

* Accept, process, or allocate payments
* Modify or update account data
* File returns or calculate tax liabilities

### Intended users

* Third-party developers building tax/accounting software
* Digital agents integrating with HMRC systems on behalf of clients

This API plays a supporting role in HMRC’s efforts to improve payment accuracy and user understanding by equipping external systems with reliable SA account data.
